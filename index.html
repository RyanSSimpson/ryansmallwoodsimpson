                <p class="stats-title">Summary</p>
                <p class="stats-paragraph">Futurist Arthur C. Clark once said: "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from
                magic". Nothing better embodies this concept than computers, and creatng this magic is what I have
                dedicated my life to. Afer high school, I formally began this pursuit by undertaking an
                undergraduate Bachelor of Computer Science at Adelaide University.</p>
                <p class="stats-paragraph">Afer graduaton I was eager to take what I'd learnt into the real world. Afer declining an invitaton
                to do honours, I immediately founded Krion Games with a few other alumni with whom I shared a
                similar work ethic and passion for video game development. Six months later, we released our frst
                game, Greg's Eggventure, for iPhone and Android mobile devices. Following this success, we began
                development on our second game, Scale Seeker, which we entered in Adelaide University's 2016
                Tech eChallenge, where it won the competton and us a trip to Microsoft HQ in Seattle to speak
                about it.</p>
                <p class="stats-paragraph">I am a results-focused individual, and have worked to successful results on both solo projects and as
                part of larger teams. Founding a company has taught me to handle a large variety of tasks- both
                sofware and business related- and to give each its due diligence. I have competed in athletcs all of
                my life, and this has taught me the discipline required to persevere with harder, long term goals
                which require a consistent work ethic to complete.</p>
